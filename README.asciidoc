= That's Interesting

*That's interesting* is a strongly typed logging framework targeting applications that want to aggregate their log messages into a single system, such as the ever famous ELK stack.

== Usage

The framework works by defining logger interfaces (called "point of interest") such as: 

[source, java]
----
package your.own.package

public interface YourOwnPOI {

    void somethingInteresting(YourPOJO pojo);

}
----

You use that interface together with the `Interested` class like this to create an instance at runtime:

[source, java]
----
import de.xn__ho_hia.interesting.Interested;

YourOwnPOI poi = Interested.in(YourOwnPOI.class);
----

Finally, use the created instance at runtime to log something that is of interest to your application:

[source, java]
----
poi.somethingInteresting(pojo);
----

== Tips & Tricks

Configuring your points of interest outside of the classes that are using those has the advantage that none of the using classes have a compile time dependency on any classes in this library.
